Customer loyalty is crucial for a company's growth. Predicting when customers are likely to leave, or "churn," is a major concern. Our goal with this project is to explore how to predict churn and determine which marketing campaigns can help retain customers.
The primary objective is to compare different models capable of predicting customer churn. To do this, we will use customer data to identify signs that they may be leaving the company. Data on customers, such as the price paid for a museum pass, the type of discount they benefit from, or whether they are new subscribers are relevant to predict customer turnover.
Subsequently, we will assess the efficiency of a marketing campaign in retaining customers we
believe will churn. For that, we are going to analyze the cumulative profit that each predicting model will generate.
